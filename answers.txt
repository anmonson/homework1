What is the difference between a merge and a rebase? 
In summary, merge maintains branch histories but can be more cluttered, 
while rebase provides a cleaner history but rewrites commit history and 
may lead to conflicts. The choice between them depends on the specific 
needs of your project and team workflow.Â 

What is a remote repository? 
A remote repository in Git is a centralized storage location separate from 
your local computer where project code and version history are stored. It 
facilitates collaboration among multiple developers by allowing them to 
share, synchronize, and work on the same codebase. Remote repositories are 
hosted on services like GitHub and provide a backup of the project's code, 
access control, and a platform for managing collaboration through features 
like pull requests and issue tracking.
