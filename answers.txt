What is the difference between a merge and a rebase? 
In summary, merge maintains branch histories but can be more cluttered, 
while rebase provides a cleaner history but rewrites commit history and 
may lead to conflicts. The choice between them depends on the specific 
needs of your project and team workflow.Â
